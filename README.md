*******************************
For the solutions to this exercise, I am using Java 21 and ide as Intellij.

I have included JUnit as a dependency for simulating test and edge cases. 
I have included, the possible outcomes and clearly wrote passing tests for each.


### How to run 
***************

- Clone the project and cd into the folder.
- While at the cli, use command idea . to open  intellij to load the project, or drag and drop the pom.xml to the intellij to open.
- Wait for the download and resolving of junit dependency.
- Each Question is contained in its package and in the same class I  have implemented the main method to run the project.
- If one is using cli tool like command prompt, warp etc. cd to individual package and use javac class name with extension to compile and then java class name to run.
- N/B the last  question, I have got two classes, so compile and run them as well.
